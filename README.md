# WEBPACK WANNABE TEMPLATE

A convenience webpack template I made. Nothing too fancy, just sufficient for most react + stylus tasks, with webpack-dev-server and html files handled not too shabbily. 

It's more or less a work in progress. Will update this as I see fit. Feel free to get in touch with me and maybe we can make this a more generalist project.

Thanks for taking the time.
